								  swine. Male pigs are 
								  called boars; female pigs are 
								  called sows. Pigs are found and 
								  raised all over the world, and 
								  provide valuable products to 
								  humans, including pork, and lard. 
								  Most pigs raised in the United 
								  States are classified as 
								  meat-type pigs.
